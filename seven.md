# Achievements

This sprint was the bug fix sprint, where all we would do is fix bugs, which was a nice release of technical debt. This is also the final sprint.

___

In this sprint I was assigned and completed the following tasks:

## Multiple dials on homepage

![Issue 42](/img/42_issue.jpg)

This issue was unable to be reproduced on the testing server, and so could not be addressed until further occurrences of this bug.

## SQL error when asking coach for advice

![Issue 81](/img/81_issue.jpg)

This issue was very easy to fix, all that was needed was to check for a query returning null and to throw an error to the page explaining so.

Evidence of completed task:

## Arbitrary gender field value.

![Issue 55](/img/55_issue.jpg)

While this makes the database hold unnecessary string values, this was considered not an issue, and even potentially beneficial if in the future the client wanted to implement arbitrary gender values for inclusivity's sake.

# Agile

Like in most every other sprint, the kanban board was used extensively, however this time, specific labels were used, namely the 'invalid' label to denote bugs thatwere not valid, or did not contain enough information to reliably replicate, and the 'wont fix' label, to denote something that isn't considered a bug or won't be fixed due to future possibility with it.

Other than that, teamwork continued to chug along like normal, and since this week was a bug fix only week, it was a nice release being able to fix our technical debts that had been building up in the backlog that weren't priority issues.

# Self Reflection

## What did I do well?

Like usual, I did my assigned tasks, however, I as able to make use of the less-used features of the github issues system that I hadn't previously used other than labels we would use in every sprint.

## What could I have done better?

Communication slacked a bit this sprint, since we are so 'in the groove' that we sort of didn't *have* to communicate for things other than individual issues that weren't already conveyed through github issues or the kanban board.

## What lessons did I learn?

It's really nice fixing bugs that have existed long-term, and that bug sprints should happen regularly so that the technical debt doesn't pile up until it can't be handled.

## What barriers did I encounter?

None.
