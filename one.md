# Achievements
For a first sprint, I think the groups gets on well and we haven't identified any potential conflicts, so I think we will be able to work well as a group.

This sprint, the group managed to have a standup meeting every few days, and it kept us on track to deliver to our customer. This was because we all mostly shared similar classes during the weeks, so it was very easy to do.
Unfortunately, we were unable to meet with our client because they ended up being busy so we rescheduled the meeting with him the same day. At this meething, we were able to present the features we had promised to our client, although with some small technical difficulties having to do with laravel file permissions which was solved in-meeting.

Overall, I believe we worked as a group well however, we need to communicate with each other more regularly in our slack channel.

In this sprint I was assigned and completed the following tasks:

## Enter sleep data

![Issue 10](/img/10_issue.jpg)

This issue required me to create a database migration to add a 'sleep' field to each user, and a method of inputting that sleep data.

The form can be seen below:

## Calendar displays exercise records incorrectly

![Issue 21](/img/21_issue.jpg)

This issue was a trivial fix, the code originally tried to display the session from the day recorded in the database to the following day, which was undefined so it would extend from the session date until the current date regardless of what day it was as seen below:

And the with the fix implemented:

## Empty data fields cause errors

![Issue 22](/img/22_issue.jpg)

This issue was covered as part of input validation for the 'record your life' section of the site, which was handled by another group member.

# Agile
This sprint went smoothly thanks to the use of the github projects kanban board, and that it made it easier for everyone in the group to keep track of what everyone else is working on. Because of this, we were able to Deliver the promised features to the customer on-time.

# Self Reflection

## What did I do well?
I completed the tasks in a quick and timely manner with little to no roadblocks along the way.
I also ended up

## What could I have done better?
I think I need to engage with my team more so that I can help them get on track, I also need to have tasks assigned in a more organised manner.
I also need to engage with the customer more often, so that I can adapt to changes quicker.

## What lessons did I learn?
I learned 2 weeks is a long time, and I should give bigger workloads to myself and team members so procrastination doesn't start to take hold.

## What barriers did I encounter?
I don't remember any barriers from the duration of this sprint.
